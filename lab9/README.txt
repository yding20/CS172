1. The first problem use method from link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/
2. Second problem different from the version from // https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-tree-from-given-inorder-and-preorder-traversal/ The solution is more space efficent since they use the pointer for array like BST.java and quick sort partition function. However, I copy the subarray every time, slow way.
3. It seems part3 is pre-practice of hashmap and read print to files of proj3, since I did proj3 first, part3 just use the material from proj3 
3. part3 use priority queue, poll two out and do some operation and add back the results. In Huffman coding we also need use this.
