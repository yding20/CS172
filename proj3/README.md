1. First time use Binary file and hex file. Command to open in binary xxd -b, command open in hex xxd 
2. when open the file, the first column should be the row list number, then after : is the real data. At the end of txt file, UTF-8 (binary) --> 00001010. The byte code for the end of the image is "1111 1111 1101 1001" (0xFFD9), which translates to extended ASCII "ÿÙ" (actually "ÿà" on AutoHotKey, but don't ask me why).
3. The diff command can compare to files. The ur.jpg and ur_dec.jpg is exactly same. However, alice30.txt and alice30_dec.txt, the last line is not \ No newline at end of file. I guess this is due to buffer output 8 bits at the last step, even if there is no 8 bits, so the last several bits can be unnessary. And it seems use sublime to edit there is not end size of a txt file.
